Vocational Navigator: A Digital Simulation Tool for Preparing B2 Learners for German Job Interviews and Application Tasks
Project Overview
The Vocational Navigator is a digital simulation tool that trains B2 German learners on job interviews and job applications. The tool enables the learners to be exposed to realistic, job-related situations, including responding to interview questions, writing professional CVs, and learning about the German cultural norms in job applications. The Vocational Navigator has a more practical approach to language and cultural knowledge, as compared to traditional courses, which are mainly centred on grammar and vocabulary. The tool offers interactive simulations, real-time feedback, and customized learning paths, which simplify the ability of learners to develop confidence and competence in professional communication. It equips the learners for the German job market by combining the linguistic skills with practical tasks of application in the real world.
The Vocational Navigator is intended to address the void in the existing language-learning tools by giving learners a chance to put their language skills into practice in a professional context. The tool helps learners not only to improve their language proficiency but also to understand and adapt to the specific expectations of German employers. This project is intended to equip B2 learners with the skills they need to succeed in job interviews so that they will be more competitive in the German job market. 
This project offers a holistic, context-based method of equipping learners with the skills and knowledge necessary to enter the German labour market using both language and cultural knowledge. This guarantees that not only are the learners well-versed in German but also prepared to work in a professional scenario. (Çobanoğulları, 2022).
Problem Statement and Educational Gap 
While many B2 learners of German have excellent language skills, they tend to have significant difficulties in applying these skills in job contexts, especially in job interviews and application tasks. Traditional language courses are generally geared toward general language knowledge, such as grammar and vocabulary, but fail to fully prepare learners for specific, real-world language tasks like going through the German job application process. Existing digital resources for language learning do not also target the special needs of B2 learners in preparation for professional situations, such as job interviews in Germany. There is a visible scarcity of activities in terms of interactive job-specific learning resources that give learners the chance to practise job interviews, write CVs according to German standards, or learning the cultural elements of professional communication in Germany (Çobanoğulları, 2022). The Vocational Navigator fills this gap by providing an interactive platform for learners to practise and develop the skills necessary for successful application to a job in Germany.
Target Audience
The primary target group for this project is B2 learners of German from the age of 18 to 35, who are preparing for employment or vocational training in Germany. Secondary target groups are language teachers, vocational training centres, and integration programmes, which in many cases need scalable digital tools for supporting professional language preparation. 
The Vocational Navigator can be used as a guided classroom tool, self-study tool, or blended-learning tool to support face-to-face classroom learning and enable learners to also practise on their own (Rath & Srivastava, 2024).
Justification for a Digital Solution
In German as a Foreign Language (GFL) teaching, especially at the B2 level, learners need regular exposure to the language skills that help them build the professional communication abilities required for job applications. The Vocational Navigator provides a much-needed solution with real-world tasks that go beyond simple language acquisition. By means of digital simulations, learners can go through the process of applying for jobs in a safe, supportive environment, where they will receive valuable feedback and become better prepared for applying for jobs in the real world in the German-speaking world.
Pedagogically, the project draws on task‑based learning that prioritizes meaningful, goal‑oriented activities, as well as experiential learning that encourages learners to engage directly with professional situations. It also incorporates CEFR principles, particularly the emphasis on functional language use in authentic contexts. 
In terms of accessibility, the digital format supports flexible, self‑paced learning from any location and helps reduce anxiety by allowing learners to practise safely before real interviews. It also benefits those with limited access to German‑speaking professional environments and strengthens their transferable digital literacy skills.
Acknowledged limitation 
Digital simulations cannot fully replicate real human interaction or the unpredictability of actual interviews. For this reason, Vocational Navigator is intended to complement classroom instruction and live practice rather than replace them.
System Design and Implementation Plan
System Features
The Vocational Navigator is designed to help B2 learners of the German language prepare for job interviews and job applications. The system contains interview simulations, in which the learners practise how to appropriately answer common interview questions in German. Immediate feedback is given based on their responses (issues such as pronunciation, grammar, cultural appropriateness, etc.). CV writing assistance is another important feature, which helps learners to develop a professional CV that suits the standards of the German job market. Additionally, the tool includes cultural insights, with information about the cultural norms and expectations for job interviews in Germany, including greetings, body language, and professional etiquette. These features aim at giving learners a comprehensive tool that simulates real-world job application tasks, which boosts their professional level of language proficiency.
Technical Requirements and Workflow
The Vocational Navigator is a web‑based tool built with programming and markup languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which structure and display content on webpages. Because it runs directly in a browser, it cannot operate outside of one, but it works smoothly on any device, including tablets and mobile phones. Its backend is powered by Python, which handles core functions such as feedback processing and potential future integration of AI‑based features. The user workflow starts with the learners choosing a task from the main menu, e.g., interview simulation, CV writing, or cultural insights. After the learners finish the task, they get immediate feedback, which helps advance their skills. The system makes sure to provide a seamless and engaging user experience, which enhances learning and improvement. 
System Diagram
 
The simple system diagram show how the tool works with the main menu that leads to each of the features (interview simulations, CV writing, cultural insights). Each feature included an input phase when learners had interacted (e.g., responding to questions in an interview or filling out their CV) and a feedback phase where they received suggestions on how to do it better. The diagram showed how the different parts of the system collaborated to create a dynamic and engaging learning experience for the users. Additionally, the system was created to track learners' progress, so that they can go back and work on the tasks and track their progress over time.
Future Scaling: How the MVDP could be improved 
The Vocational Navigator is a minimum viable digital product (MVDP) with strong potential for further development and scaling to enhance its effectiveness and reach. Integrating AI‑powered feedback would allow the system to deliver more personalized and detailed assessments, offering learners tailored suggestions for improvement. This could include changing the feedback according to speech recognition patterns, providing specific suggestions for improvement in both language and professional skills (Mahamad et al., 2025).
The tool could also be upgraded to include live video‑based interviews, creating a more immersive and realistic experience. In addition, expanding the platform to cover a wider range of job sectors, such as healthcare, IT, and engineering, would provide learners with a broader set of professional tasks. Finally, extending the system to support multiple languages would make it accessible to a global audience and allow learners from diverse linguistic backgrounds to benefit from its features.
Pedagogical & Ethical Reflection 
Pedagogical Theory Supporting Design
The Vocational Navigator is based on the task-based learning (TBL) and experiential learning theories. Task-based learning is concerned with learners working on real-world tasks such as answering job interview questions and writing CVs. This method assists the learners in gaining practical experience and practising their language skills in real-life situations. The Vocational Navigator reflects this by giving learners access to realistic job application tasks, such as interviews and writing CVs, to give them opportunities to practise and reflect on their responses in a safe, digital environment. This approach promotes active learning, pushing the learner to interact with the language practically and purposefully. It also enables continuous feedback, which is helpful to reinforce learning outcomes (Jia and Bava Harji, 2023).
Experiential learning further shapes the tool’s design by emphasising the value of learning through direct experience. The platform enables learners to participate in simulated job interviews and receive feedback, creating a cycle of practice and reflection. This process encourages learners to evaluate their performance, strengthen their skills, and recognise that effective learning extends beyond theory into hands‑on application. Such an approach aligns with the goals of the Vocational Navigator, equipping learners with the confidence and competence needed to succeed in real job‑application scenarios within German‑speaking contexts (Azeez and Aboobaker, 2024).

Ethical Considerations 
The Vocational Navigator has been developed with strong ethical considerations, particularly in the areas of data privacy, fairness, and accessibility. Data privacy is ensured through the encryption of all learner information, including interview responses and CV submissions, and by adhering to GDPR guidelines. Learners retain full control over their data and can access, modify, or delete it at any time.
Fairness is also central to the system’s design. It aims to treat all learners equally by providing personalised feedback that is not influenced by their background, proficiency level, or learning style. Accessibility is another key priority: the tool supports multiple languages, offers visual aids and speech‑recognition features, and is compatible with a wide range of devices. This ensures that learners with diverse needs and varying socio‑economic circumstances can use the platform without barriers.
Together, these ethical measures ensure that the Vocational Navigator provides an inclusive, secure, and equitable learning environment for all users.
Evaluation and Testing          
The Vocational Navigator underwent both functional and usability testing. Functional testing confirmed that all the core features, such as interview simulations, CV‑writing support, and cultural insights, were operating as intended. Usability testing with B2 learners then evaluated how easy the system was to navigate and how effectively it supported their preparation for job applications. Learners find the tool intuitive to use and value the real‑time feedback provided after each task. They also recommend expanding the simulations to additional job sectors and enhancing the visual design of the interface. In response to this feedback, several improvements have been identified for future scaling, including refining the feedback mechanism and introducing more complex tasks for advanced learners.
Conclusion
The Vocational Navigator proved effective in preparing B2 learners for job applications in the German‑speaking job market. Learners feel more confident and better equipped for interviews, particularly in terms of cultural awareness and appropriate language use. The system’s real‑time feedback helps to identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time. These results demonstrate that task‑based learning and interactive simulations are valuable approaches for developing real‑world professional skills. Looking ahead, features such as AI‑driven feedback and live video simulations could further enrich the learning experience. The tool also offers strong potential for scalability, with opportunities to expand into additional job sectors and languages to support a broader, global audience.
